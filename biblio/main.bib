  abstract = {Law Enforcement agencies are faced with a problem of effectively predicting the likelihood of crime happening given the past crime data which would otherwise help them to do so. There is a need to identify the most efficient algorithm that can be used in crime prediction given the past crime data. In this research, Business intelligence techniques considered was based on supervised learning (Classification) techniques given that labeled training data was available. Four different classification algorithms that is; decision tree (J48), Na{\"i}ve Bayes, Multilayer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine were compared to find the most effective algorithm for crime prediction. The study used classification models generated using Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA). Manual method of attribute selection was used; this is because it works well when there is large number of attributes. The dataset was acquired from UCI machine learning repository website with a title `Crime and Communities'. The data set had 128 attributes of which 13 were selected for the study. The study revealed that the accuracy of J48, Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machine (SMO) is approximately 100\%, 89.7989\%, 100\% and 92.6724\%, respectively for both training and test data. Also the execution time in seconds of J48, Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and SVO is 0.06, 0.14, 9.26 and 0.66 respectively using windows7 32 bit. Hence, Decision Tree (J48) out performed Na{\"i}ve bayes, Multilayer perceptron and Support Vector Machine (SMO) algorithms, and manifested higher performance both in execution time and in accuracy. The scope of this project was to identify the most effective and accurate Business intelligence technique that can be used during crime data mining to provide accurate results.},

  abstract = {In the era of social networks, internet of things and location-based services, many online services produce a huge amount of data that have valuable objective information, such as geographic coordinates and date time. These characteristics (parameters) in the combination with a textual parameter bring the challenge for the discovery of geospatiotemporal knowledge. This challenge requires efficient methods for clustering and pattern mining in spatial, temporal and textual spaces.    In this thesis, we address the challenge of providing methods and frameworks for geospatiotemporal data analytics. As an initial step, we address the challenges of geospatial data processing: data gathering,  normalization, geolocation, and storage. That initial step is the basement to tackle the next challenge -- geospatial clustering challenge. The first step of this challenge is to design the method for online clustering of georeferenced data. This algorithm can be used as a server-side clustering algorithm for online maps that visualize massive georeferenced data. As the second step, we develop the extension of this method that considers, additionally, the temporal aspect of data. For that, we propose the density and intensity-based geospatiotemporal clustering algorithm with fixed distance and time radius.  Each version of the clustering algorithm has its own use case that we show in the thesis. In the next chapter of the thesis, we look at the spatiotemporal analytics from the perspective of the sequential rule mining challenge. We design and implement the framework that transfers data into textual geospatiotemporal data - data that contain geographic coordinates, time and textual parameters. By this way, we address the challenge of applying pattern/rule mining algorithms in geospatiotemporal space. As the applicable use case study, we propose spatiotemporal crime analytics -- discovery spatiotemporal patterns of crimes in publicly available crime data.  The second part of the thesis, we dedicate to the application part and use case studies. We design and implement the application that uses the proposed clustering algorithms to discover knowledge in data. Jointly with the application, we propose the use case studies for analysis of georeferenced data in terms of situational and public safety awareness.},

By analyzing and comparing eight known prediction models: Naive Bayes, Stacking, Random Forest, Lazy:IBK, Bagging, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network, and Locally Weighted Learning {\textendash} this study proposed an improved deep learning crime prediction model using convolutional neural networks and the xgboost algorithm to predict crime. The major goal of this research is to provide an improved crime prediction model based on previous criminal records. Using the Boston crime dataset, where our larceny crime dataset was extracted, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used to uncover patterns and explain trends in crimes. The performance of the proposed model on the basis of accuracy, recall, and f-measure was 100\% outperforming the other models used in this study. The analysis of the proposed model and prediction can aid security services in making better use of their resources, anticipating crime at a certain time, and serving the society better.},

Just like vaccination is given to a child to prevent disease, in today's world with such higher crime rate and brutal crime happenings, it have become necessary to have a vaccination systems that prevents from crimes happening. By vaccinating society against crime it refers to various methods such as educating peoples, creating awareness, increasing efficiency and proactive policing methods and other deterrent techniques. Inspired by two different existing approach to crime prediction, the first one present a visual analytics approach that provides decision makers with a proactive and predictive environment in order to assist them in making effective resource allocation and deployment decisions. Crime incident prediction has depends mainly on the historical crime record and various geospatial and demographic information [1]. Even though it's promising, they do not take into account the rich and rapidly expanding social \& web media context that surrounds incidents of interest. Next approach is based on the semantic analysis and natural language processing of Twitter posts via latent Dirichlet allocation, Topic detection \& Sentiment analysis[3[4]]. But both the techniques faces inherent limitations. Crime that happens these days are have following key characteristics such as crimes repeating in a periodic fashion, crimes occurring as a result of some other activity and occurrence of crimes pre indicated by some other information.},

We described the nature of the studied proximity strategy and evaluated it before-after through exhaustive control groups. For so, we measured correlations between crimes decreasing and Euclidean radius around Communitarian police headquarters during the period when policies were implemented. We found that police proximity and related strategies are visibly associated with crime decreasing, but other con\- texts could also be involved. We suggest studying the Ecuadorian experience in depth as an important example of crime reduction.},

Rosa in the city of Ambato. Citizens are the most affected because it is difficult for them to carry out their daily activities normally since they, their relatives or their material goods are always in danger. Currently, many solutions are being given to different problems through the implementation of systems or apps. A clear example is the rise of applications for mobile devices that are within reach of many users simplifying their tasks and resources such as time and money. In this sense, it is opportune to implement a mobile application type panic button like the one used by the police, focused mainly on the neighbors of the neighborhoods so that they can alert among the neighborhood community any situation of risk or emergency. The purpose of this project is to support the neighborhoods of The Parish of St. Rose so that they can be prepared and prevented from the increase in crime. Therefore, these must be organized, collaborative and participatory, so that they can provide help to the citizen in danger and thus give a warning message to criminals. During the analysis and development of the technologies for the implementation of the application, comparisons were made with the aim of determining the free and free tools that help obtain quality software and avoid incurring expenses for those who will use the application. The most important tools that were used during the development were Ionic and Angular for the Frontend, Node.js and MongoDB for the Backend, the agile Mobile-D development methodology was also used since it easily adapts to this type of projects that do not require many modules or a lot of time for their implementation.},

We introduce a class of spatially correlated self-exciting spatio-temporal models for count data that capture both dependence due to self-excitation, as well as dependence in an underlying spatial process. We follow the principles in Clark and Dixon (2021) but considering a generalized additive structure on spatio-temporal varying covariates. A Bayesian framework is proposed for inference of model parameters. We analyze three distinct crime datasets in the city of Riobamba (Ecuador). Our model fits the data well and provides better predictions than other alternatives.},

  abstract = {Examining the levels of both the spatial and the temporal clustering of crime events raises the analysis of events as spatial patterns at different time periods to understanding them as spatial processes. There have been, however, only limited efforts in doing so, possibly due to a lack of effective methods for estimating, identifying the difference in the levels of spatial clustering patterns, and visualizing the spatiotemporal trends among the events. We first describe a method for examining the periodicity of space{\textendash}time crime events. Two indexes are extended from the Moran's index for spatial autocorrelation and local indicator of spatial association (LISA) to ones for including spatiotemporal event-region data. We also suggest a three-dimensional approach to visualizing spatiotemporal associations among event regions that enables a better understanding of the spatial processes behind the evolution of event regions. An implementation of the suggested methods that use data of three types of crime events in Akron, Ohio, is reported. The suggested approach is capable of summarizing spatiotemporal autocorrelation as well as identifying spatiotemporal clusters of crime events. Compared to layered LISA, this approach works well, and it allows three-dimensional visualizations of spatiotemporal clusters of events that can help to develop effective policing strategies for combating crimes.},

Thus, the spatial concentration of homicides committed in the Argentine city of Santa Fe between 2001 and 2020 was examined. In addition, this study examined the temporal stability of the concentration and trajectories of the identified hot spots. The results were contrasted with the ``law of crime concentration'' proposed in a previous study and with the results of other studies on crime concentration conducted in the region of Latin America. The findings suggested that homicides committed in the city of Santa Fe were spatially concentrated and that their concentration levels had remained stable over the years. Although two-thirds of the microunits did not experience homicides during the analysis period (2001{\textendash}2020), a disproportionate number of homicides occurred in a small group of microunits. The study findings will prove useful in decision-making regarding place-based crime prevention strategies.},

Data driven researches are useful to prevent and solve crime. Recent research shows that 50\% of the crimes are committed by only handful of offenders. The law enforcement officers need early information about the criminal activity to response and solve the spatio-temporal criminal activity. In this research, supervised learning algorithms are used to predict criminal activity. The proposed data driven system predicts crimes by analyzing San Francisco city criminal activity data set for 12 years. Decision tree and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms are applied to predict crime. But these two algorithms provide low accuracy in prediction. Then, random forest is applied as an ensemble methods and adaboost is used as a boosting method to increase the accuracy of prediction. However, log-loss is used to measure the performance of classifiers by penalizing false classifications. As the dataset contains highly class imbalance problems, a random undersampling method for random forest algorithm gives the best accuracy. The final accuracy is 99.16\% with 0.17\% log loss.},

Methodologically, these approaches are limited by an inability to overcome the small number problem, which occurs in spatiotemporal analysis at the small-area level when crime and population counts for areas are low. The small number problem may lead to unstable risk estimates and unreliable results. Also, conventional approaches use only one data observation per area, providing limited information about the temporal processes influencing hotspots and how law enforcement resources should be allocated to manage crime change. Examining violent crime in the               R               egional               M               unicipality of               Y               ork,               O               ntario, for 2006 and 2007, this research illustrates a               B               ayesian spatiotemporal modeling approach that analyzes crime trend and identifies hotspots while addressing the small number problem and overcoming limitations of conventional frequentist methods. Specifically, this research tests for an overall trend of violent crime for the study region, determines area-specific violent crime trends for small-area units, and identifies hotspots based on crime trend from 2006 to 2007. Overall violent crime trend was found to be insignificant despite increasing area-specific trends in the north and decreasing area-specific trends in the southeast. Posterior probabilities of area-specific trends greater than zero were mapped to identify hotspots, highlighting hotspots in the north of the study region. We discuss the conceptual differences between this               B               ayesian spatiotemporal method and conventional frequentist approaches as well as the effectiveness of this               B               ayesian spatiotemporal approach for identifying hotspots from a law enforcement perspective.},

In contrast to panel data, such spatial data pooled over time reflect multi-directional spatial effects but only unidirectional temporal effects, which are challenging to analyze. This paper presents an innovative approach to address this challenge {\textendash} a geographically and temporally weighted co-location quotient which includes global and local computation, a method to calculate a spatiotemporal weight matrix and a significance test using Monte Carlo simulation. This new approach is used to identify spatio-temporal crime patterns across Greater Manchester in 2016 from open source recorded crime data. The results show that this approach is suitable for the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal dependence and heterogeneity in categorical spatial data pooled over time. It is particularly useful for detecting symmetrical spatio-temporal colocation patterns and mapping local clusters. The method also addresses the unbalanced temporal scale problem caused by unidirectional temporal data representation and explores potential impacts. The empirical evidence of the spatiotemporal crime patterns might usefully be deployed to inform the development of criminological theory by helping to disentangle the relationships between crime and the urban environment.},

Specifically, the potential use of ambient population as a crime rate denominator and predictor for predictive policing models is evaluated, using mobile phone data (with a total of 9,397,473 data points) as a proxy. The results show that ambient population correlates more strongly with crime than residential population. Crime rates based on ambient population designate different problem areas than crime rates based on residential population. The prediction performance of predictive policing models can be improved by using ambient population instead of residential population. These findings support that ambient population is a more suitable population-at-risk measure, as it better reflects the underlying dynamics in spatiotemporal crime trends. Its use has therefore much as-of-yet unused potential not only for criminal research and theory testing, but also for intelligence-led policy and practice.},

  abstract = {A crime is a deliberate act that can cause physical or psychological harm, as well as property damage or loss, and can lead to punishment by a state or other authority according to the severity of the crime. The number and forms of criminal activities are increasing at an alarming rate, forcing agencies to develop efficient methods to take preventive measures. In the current scenario of rapidly increasing crime, traditional crime-solving techniques are unable to deliver results, being slow paced and less efficient. Thus, if we can come up with ways to predict crime, in detail, before it occurs, or come up with a ``machine'' that can assist police officers, it would lift the burden of police and help in preventing crimes. To achieve this, we suggest including machine learning (ML) and computer vision algorithms and techniques. In this paper, we describe the results of certain cases where such approaches were used, and which motivated us to pursue further research in this field. The main reason for the change in crime detection and prevention lies in the before and after statistical observations of the authorities using such techniques. The sole purpose of this study is to determine how a combination of ML and computer vision can be used by law agencies or authorities to detect, prevent, and solve crimes at a much more accurate and faster rate. In summary, ML and computer vision techniques can bring about an evolution in law agencies.},

Crime datasets of the State of North Carolina have been used for this purpose. The paper aims to check different statistical parameters and figure out the most common factors that affect crime. The univariate and bivariate exploratory analysis is used for extracting the most dominant features.

  abstract = {Forecasting crime is complex since several complicated aspects contribute to a crime. Predicting crime becomes more challenging because of the enormous number of everyday crime episodes in varied places. Though there are many established machine learning and deep learning techniques, law enforcement officers face challenges in preventing crime from occurring promptly. An efficient way of law enforcement is required to lower the crime rates. This paper proposed an effective multi-module method for predicting crime using deep learning techniques. Our proposed method has two modules: Feature Level Fusion and Decision Level Fusion. The first module employs temporal-based Attention LSTM, Spatio-Temporal based Stacked Bidirectional LSTM, and Fusion model. The Fusion model leverages the prior two models' training data. The temporal-based model is the source model for the transfer learning technique on the dataset of different cities. By applying this technique, the training time of the model is reduced. In the second module, the Spatio-Temporal based Attention-LSTM, Stacked Bidirectional LSTM, and the result of feature-level fusion module are used to get the final prediction. The proposed architecture predicts the next hour based on the data from the past twenty-four hours. The estimated number of crimes in any category for a particular location can be obtained as the output of our suggested model. It also enables law enforcement to get insight into future crime occurrences based on category, time, and location. This work concentrated mainly on the USA's San Francisco and Chicago cities for the experimental analysis. For the San Francisco and Chicago datasets, our model has the Mean Absolute Error of 0.008, 0.02, the Coefficient of Determination of 0.95 and 0.94, and the Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error of 1.03\% and 0.6\%, respectively. The proposed model outperforms numerous other well-known models.},

In previous work, crime prediction has been performed by identifying hotspots from data, which means areas of high criminal activity on the streets. By focusing efforts on such sites, police patrolling is expected to be more efficient, thus reducing criminal activity. However, not many studies focus on investigating how police patrolling affects crime, and whether it can be a predictor of crime activity. In this paper we discuss the main challenges of this problem, and describe some work in progress towards developing a robust methodology to represent, visually analyze, and build predictors for criminal activity, considering both criminal and police patrolling spatiotemporal data. As a case study, we use real datasets from the Military Police of the state of Alagoas, Brazil (PM-AL).},

In addition, we propose a Criminal Hotspot Locating (CHL) algorithm to predict and highlight the hotspot areas for the prevention of the target place. Moreover, to improve the performance of the proposed CPD system that mainly contains CAC, CRE, and CHL algorithms, we implement a parallel solution for these algorithms using high-performance computing power.

Machine learning is the current mainstream prediction method. However, few studies have systematically compared different machine learning methods for crime prediction. This paper takes the historical data of public property crime from 2015 to 2018 from a section of a large coastal city in the southeast of China as research data to assess the predictive power between several machine learning algorithms. Results based on the historical crime data alone suggest that the LSTM model outperformed KNN, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and convolutional neural networks. In addition, the built environment data of points of interests (POIs) and urban road network density are input into LSTM model as covariates. It is found that the model with built environment covariates has better prediction effect compared with the original model that is based on historical crime data alone. Therefore, future crime prediction should take advantage of both historical crime data and covariates associated with criminological theories. Not all machine learning algorithms are equally effective in crime prediction.},
